Installation
============

To install the GARCH Project, perform the following steps in terminal:

Note: If you're a Windows user, you'll need to `source venv/bin/activate.bat`, iirc.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/garthmortensen/garch.git
   cd garch
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
